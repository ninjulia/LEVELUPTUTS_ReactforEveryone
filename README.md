# Work for Level Up Tutorials' Mastering React Course

This project was built as a solution to [Part 1: React 16 For Everyone](https://levelup.video/tutorials/react-16-for-everyone/) and [Part 2: Redux and React](https://levelup.video/tutorials/redux-and-react-for-everyone/). This project is part of their [Mastering React Training Course](https://levelup.video/paths/mastering-react). The tutorial was recorded several years ago using Reactv16, currently, React is on v18. I have researched modern methods and deviated from the tutorial where appropriate. See the Project section for more details.

## Installing / Getting started

The Movie Database (TMBD) API Key is defined in Netlify Environmental Variable. You MUST use Netlify to access the project in development. Using the standard `npm run dev` command will throw errors since Vite doesn't have access to the variable.

```shell
npx netlify dev # spins up Server on http://localhost:8888
```

## Overview

### The challenge

Build a React web application using provided CSS. Users should be able to:

- See a collection of the latest movies from [The Movie Database (TMDB)](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
- Click on a movie for more details
- Visit a unique url for each movie
- Limit API calls by leveraging their local storage

TODO:

- Search for movie by methods available in the API call
- See a list of movies with pagination
- Click on a movie for more details

## My process

### Built with

- vite
- netlify

### Project

As of late 2023, React is on vs 18. The tutorial was recorded on React 16, using create-react-app. A look at FreeCodeCamp's [How to Build a React App â€“ A Walkthrough of the Many Different Ways](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-react-app-different-ways) directed me to use [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/).

Notable deviations from the Tutorial include:

- leveraging recommended react hooks such as `useEffect()`
- passing MovieDetails as props to avoid another API call
- set page title dynamically **TODO: set in state**
- **TODO: replaced outdated react-overdrive with another route-based animation toolset**

### NOTE

STILL EVALUATING react-overdrive not compatible with React18, used AutoAnimate instead
